Weather Forecasting & Detection Tool
Machine Learning + Django + HTML/CSS/JavaScript

📌 Project Title
Weather Forecasting and Detection System Using Machine Learning

📖 Description
This project is a web-based Weather Forecasting & Condition Detection Tool that uses:
Machine Learning algorithms 
Live weather API data Django backend
HTML, CSS & JavaScript for UI


The system predicts and displays:

Temperature
Humidity
Wind Speed
Atmospheric Pressure
Weather Conditions (Rain, Clear, Cloudy, etc.)

The UI changes dynamically with weather-based background videos.

⚙️ How It Works

User enters a city name.

Django sends a request to the weather API.

API returns real-time weather data.

ML model processes the data and predicts the weather condition.

Django renders results to the frontend.

JavaScript updates the UI (values, icons, background video).

User gets a clean, modern, real-time weather report.
